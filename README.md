# Project ATLAS

Project ATLAS is a ROS 2 Humble autonomous service rover running Ubuntu 22.04 on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super 8GB.

## Hardware

- Four-wheel rover with wheel encoders and Yahboom motor controller
- RPLIDAR A1, BNO08X IMU, ultrasonic sensors, and RD-03D radar
- IMX708 Camera Module 3 on a pan/tilt platform
- GNSS, BMS, BME680, AMG8833 8x8 thermal sensor, Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity
- ESP32-S3 voice interface and 11-inch touchscreen dashboard

## Repository layout

- `project_atlas_ws/src/`: ROS 2 packages and launch/configuration files
- `project_atlas/scripts/`: operational nodes, dashboard, diagnostics, voice, and recovery tools
- `project_atlas/config/`: robot configuration
- `project_atlas/maps/`: current mapping assets

Generated ROS directories, local environments, models, logs, credentials, and historical backups are intentionally excluded.

## Engineering policy

Reliability and safety come before new capability. Implement one feature at a time, build and test it, update documentation, and commit it. Emergency stop must override manual, web, voice, and autonomous commands.

## Development baseline

1. Verify hardware diagnostics and TF.
2. Validate wheel odometry and IMU fusion.
3. Validate localization and Nav2.
4. Tune perception and human-aware behavior only after navigation is stable.
